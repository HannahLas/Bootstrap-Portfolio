## My third challenge with the edX Bootcamp

I completed this task for the third challenge in my Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. The purpose of this task was to create a work portfolio for employers to see my work, using the Bootstrap skills I have learned. I can add to the page as I complete more projects during the course. I wrote the HTML and CSS from scratch. I copied and pasted the Bootstrap link and included a 'jumbotron' section along with cards from Bootstrap. I also imported a nav bar from Bootstrap. 

## Usage
Click on the links in the navigation bar to be directed to the relevant section of the website. See the screenshot below to see the navigation bar:

## Acknowledgements

I had a tutor session to help me understand how to make the image in my first card smaller; I used padding to help make the image appear smaller. 
The tutor also helped me to centre my CV button when I made the screen smaller:
 .button-container {
    display:flex;
    justify-content: center;
    }
